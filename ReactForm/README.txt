Hi there,

This is my attempt at the task regarding the Web App
developer role. My latest framework I've been learning
is React so that's what I've used in this- also a 
good chance to strengthen my skills in it using things 
such as useState,components,props and conditional 
rendering together. 

I've added some validation- Age restriction being 18 
entering Date of Birth and general validation ensuring
the user can't continue with empty fields.

If dedicating more time to this I would create
stronger validation e.g. needing a certain amount of 
characters for the fields,focus on making 
the components more reusable,focusing on
actually storing the user's data and lastly
improving the appearance to match the website.

Thanks for the opportunity.

Kind Regards,
Liam
